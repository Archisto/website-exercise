# Website Exercise: Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit

A website exercise project for school. The languages used are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The text in the site is mostly in pseudo-Latin placeholder text but some key words are in Finnish.
The site uses a header and a footer. Only the first three links in the header are usable.
The pages excluding the table page scale with the browser, and when the browser is narrow enough, a burger menu is displayed.
All of the site's features, styles and colors were listed in a requirement document.

## Pages

### Front Page / Etusivu
Has text arranged into two columns and an image.
